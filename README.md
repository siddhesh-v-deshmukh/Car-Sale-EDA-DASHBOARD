# Car Sales Analysis | Python + Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python with a **Power BI dashboard** to analyze car sales data and extract meaningful business insights. It simulates a real-world scenario of understanding used car trends based on selling price, condition, fuel type, and other vehicle features.
